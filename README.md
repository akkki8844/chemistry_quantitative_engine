# chemistry_quantitative_engine
This terminal-based AI system models chemical reactions using mathematical rules. By changing quantities like reactant amounts, concentration, and efficiency, the program predicts outcomes such as limiting reactants, reaction rates, and yield. It proves that chemical transformation is governed by quantitative relationships, not intention.
